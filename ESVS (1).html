        </div>

        <p class="text">The ESVS has developed clinical practice guidelines for the care of patients with aneurysms of the abdominal aorta and iliac artery, with the aim of assisting physicians in selecting the best management strategy.
        </p>

        <p class="text">The first ESVS abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) guideline was published as a supplement in EJVES in 2011, under the leadership of Frans Moll.<a href="485"><span class="text-sup">485</span></a> Since then it has been the most cited (396 citations
            during 2010e2014) and downloaded (>3000 in 2015) paper in the <span class="italic">EJVES</span> with a major impact on clinical practice and research. In 2015, the ESVS GC, under the leadership of Philippe Kolh, initiated a process to update
            the AAA guideline.
        </p>

        <p class="text">The present guideline is a complete makeover. Several new topics, not addressed in the previous 2011 guidelines, have been added, such as juxtarenal AAA, isolated iliac aneurysms, mycotic and inflammatory aneurysms, and concomitant malignant disease.
            Also, new treatment concepts, such as fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), chimney EVAR (chEVAR) and endovascular aneurysm seal (EVAS) are covered. Furthermore, service standards and logistics of importance, including surgical
            volume requirements and acceptable waiting time for surgery, are addressed. The patient’s perspective has been included for the first time in an ESVS guideline. For already established topics, several updated recommendations have been made
            based on new data/evidence, such as recommendations on an EVAR first strategy for ruptured AAA (rAAA), a stratified less frequent follow up regimen after EVAR, and an updated surveillance protocol for small AAAs and subaneurysms.
        </p>

        <p class="text">The guideline, written and approved by the 16 members of the GWC, who are all members of the ESVS, is based on scientific evidence completed with expert opinion on the matter. By summarising and evaluating the best available evidence, recommendations
            for the evaluation and treatment of patients have been formulated.</p>

        <p class="text">The recommendations represent the general knowledge at the time of publication, but technology and disease knowledge in this field may change rapidly; therefore, recommendations can become outdated. It is an aim of the ESVS to update the guidelines
            when important new insights in the evaluation and management of diseases of the abdominal aorta and iliac artery become available.</p>

        <p class="text">Although guidelines have the purpose of promoting a standard of care according to specialists in the field, under no circumstance should this guideline be seen as the legal standard of care in all patients. The document provides a guiding principle,
            but the care given to an individual patient is always dependent on many factors including symptoms, comorbidities, age, level of activity, treatment setting, available techniques, and other factors.</p>

        The GWC convened on January 18, 2016, during a meeting in Hamburg. At that meeting the tasks in creating the guideline were evaluated and distributed among the committee members. Following preparation of the ﬁrst draft, GWC members participated in a second
        meeting in Uppsala in March 2017 to review the wording/grading of each recommendation. If there was no unanimous agreement, discussions were held to decide how to reach a consensus. If this failed, then the wording, grade, and level of evidence
        was secured via a majority vote of the GWC members. The ﬁnal version of the guideline was submitted in June 2018.

        <p class="text">Members of the committee, supported by clinical librarians performed the literature search for this guideline systematically in Medline (through PubMed), Embase, Clinical Trial databases, and the Cochrane Library up to December 31, 2016. Reference
            checking and hand search by the GWC members added other relevant literature. A second literature search for papers published between May 2016 and January 2018 was performed in May 2018. The members of the GWC performed the literature selection
            based on information provided in the title and abstract of the retrieved studies.</p>
        <p class="text">Criteria for search and selection were (1) Language: English. (2) Level of evidence: Selection of the literature was performed following the pyramid of evidence, with aggregated evidence at the top of the pyramid (systematic reviews, metaanalyses),
            then randomised controlled trials, then observational studies. Single case reports, animal studies, and in vitro studies at the bottom of the pyramid were excluded, leaving expert opinions at the bottom of the pyramid. The level of evidence
            per section in the guideline is dependent on the level of evidence available on the speciﬁc subject. (3) Sample size: Larger studies were given more weight than smaller studies. (4) Relevant articles published after the search date or in another
            language were included, but only if they were of paramount importance to this guideline.</p>

        <p class="text">To deﬁne the current guidelines, members of the GWC reviewed and summarised the selected literature. Conclusions were drawn based on the scientiﬁc evidence. The recommendations in the guidelines in this document are based on the European Society
            of Cardiology (ESC) grading system. For each recommendation, the letter A, B, or C marks the level of current evidence (Table 1.1). Weighing the level of evidence and expert opinion, every recommendation is subsequently marked as either Class
            I, IIa, IIb, or III (Table 1.2).</p>

        <p class="text">In order to improve accessibility and interpretability for patients and the public the plain English summaries for these guidelines were subjected to a lay review process. Information for patients was drafted for each subchapter which was read
            and amended by a vascular nurse specialist and at least one lay person or patient, before going to the Leicester patient focus group (PFG) for their opinions.</p>
        <p class="text">Men with small AAA under surveillance in the Leicester (UK) Vascular Surgery Unit were invited to attend a focus group meeting. All men had previously attended a patient education event to provide information about the clinical management of small
            AAA. This included the rationale for intervention thresholds, measures to improve fitness in preparation for surgery, and how decisions between endovascular repair, open surgery, and optimal medical therapy are made when a patient is referred
            for consideration of surgery.
        </p>
        <p class="text">Eight men attended a focus group discussion in November 2016 and July 2017. The provisional plain English summaries for the guidelines had been sent to the group of men attending, one week prior to the meeting. The men had been asked to read the
            text in preparation for the meeting. At the meeting the background to the ESVS guideline development process was presented.
        </p>
        <p class="text">The main theme that arose fromthe discussions was that of clarity, consistency, and simplicity in the presentation of facts and recommendations in the plain English summaries. A recurring example raised by the men in the group was the requirement
            for contextualisationwhen presenting risk, which was incorporated into subsequent drafts. Other changes that were made in response to the input of the PFG were the combination of all plain English summaries into a single document with a strong
            focus on dispelling medical myths about AAA, the provision of more information about how an individual may reduce their risk from AAA/surgery and the generation of a list of key facts about AAA for public use.</p>
        <p class="text">The PFG activities were conducted in Leicester, UK and involved only men with small AAAs under surveillance. No women with AAA, or the partners of patients were involved in the exercise. These limitations should be taken into consideration when
            reviewing this report.</p>

            management and treatment of AAA. The recommendations made herein are only valid as long as all parts of the chain have sufﬁcient quality and availability. Whenever these requirements cannot be provided locally, patients should be transferred
            to an appropriate centre. Referral should take into account the patient’s preference.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="text">The importance of quality control in vascular surgery is well established. More than 40 years ago, the American Heart Association<span class="s15">’</span>s Committee on Vascular Surgery had already recommended as a minimum standard that “vascular
            surgeons keep standardised and detailed records so that their work may be readily judged by its results”.<a href="157"><span class="text-sup">157</span></a> Local, regional, and national vascular surgical quality registries exist in many countries
            and allow for continuous assessment of aortic practice and its outcome in participating centres.<a href="48"><span class="text-sup">48</span></a><span class="text-sup">,</span><a href="439"><span
                    class="text-sup">439</span></a><span class="text-sup">,</span>
            <a href="481"><span class="text-sup">481</span></a> Clinical audit of key outcome parameters (e.g. peri-operative mortality after elective aortic repair) allows for identiﬁcation of outliers, and appropriate intervention to improve outcomes.
            <a href="220"><span class="text-sup">220</span></a> This is particularly important in the era of rapid technical and medical development, such as the introduction of new endovascular technologies and screening. The increasing use of endovascular
            techniques has resulted in an ongoing change in indications with older and more comorbid patients being treated
            <a href="401"><span class="text-sup">401</span></a> and a continuing evolution of EVAR devices, which have been assessed with variable rigour for different periods of follow up. Centres performing surgical treatment of AAA should therefore
            preferably participate in registries which allow for continuous quality control assessment. To allow for meaningful evaluation of surgical quality, internal and external validity of such registries is of utmost importance.
            <a href="700"><span class="text-sup">700</span></a>,<a href="740"><span class="text-sup">740</span></a> Generally, cases that are not registered tend to have worse outcomes.
            <a href="185"><span class="text-sup">185</span></a> Population based prospective registries are also a dynamic complement to randomised controlled trials (RCT) in providing pilot data early on as well as later monitoring the generalisability
            of new treatment strategies and technologies. Both randomised and nonrandomised sources of evidence have strengths and weaknesses.<a href="116"><span class="text-sup">116</span></a> High quality and validated registries have a low risk of
            bias and reﬂect the daily practice over a longer time period and are region, nation, or continentwide. Aggregated results from RCTs and prospective registries have the potential to be major assets in guiding the local vascular surgeon as well
            as nationwide policy makers.<a href="32"><span class="text-sup">32</span></a>
            <p class="text">Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are questionnaires that provide a means of measuring health or quality of life (QoL) from the patient’s perspective.<a href="175"><span
                        class="text-sup">175</span></a> Recently, three disease speciﬁc questionnaires were developed to assess QoL, symptoms and treatment satisfaction in patient with AAA; The Aneurysm Dependent Quality of Life Questionnaire (AneurysmDQoL),
                The Aneurysm Symptom Rating Questionnaire (AneurysmSRQ), The Aneurysm Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (AneurysmTSQ).<span class="text">546,547</span> So far they have only been used in a small pilot study; however, showing their potential
                for patients with small AAAs under surveillance as well as before and after surgical repair,
                <a href="546"><span class="text-sup">546</span></a><span class="text-sup">,</span><a href="547"><span
                        class="text-sup">547</span></a> and in a systematic review and qualitative evidence synthesis they were superior to generic PROMs, such as Short Form 36 and the Australian Vascular Quality of Life Index, in assessment of items
                important to patients with an AAA.<a href="175"><span class="text-sup">175</span></a> Further evaluation and reﬁnement of AAA speciﬁc PROMs and their implementation, preferably within the framework of vascular surgery quality registries,
                are warranted.</p>

        <p class="text">The management of AAA has changed profoundly with the introduction of endovascular treatment options. Studies have convincingly shown the beneﬁt of EVAR in both elective and emergency AAA repair in patients with suitable anatomy. The continuously
            decreasing peri-operative mortality and simultaneous increase in the utilisation of EVAR (at the expense of open surgical repair (OSR)) observed in several large population based studies, representing real world data, has provided additional
            support for the use of EVAR as an essential part of modern AAA treatment. This is also reﬂected by the recommendations made in this updated guideline.</p>
        <p class="text">At the same time, it is evident that some patients are not suitable for standard EVAR or more complex new endovascular treatment options but should instead be offered open surgery. Furthermore, complications after EVAR are not uncommon and may
            require elective as well as acute open surgical treatment. Similarly, OSR may sometimes require adjuvant endovascular treatment.</p>
        <p class="text">Consequently, one technique cannot entirely replace the other, at least not yet. Compromising the anatomical requirements for standard EVAR or using complex and partially unexplored endovascular techniques to avoid an established open surgical
            solution at all costs, or just offering major open surgery when there are proven minimally invasive techniques just because it is outside ofﬁce hours, is not only unscientiﬁc, it is also unethical. Thus, today it is not acceptable to perform
            aortic surgery without the ability to offer both technologies 24/7.<a href="50"><span

        </div>

        <p class="text">The relationship between surgical volume (caseload) and outcome has been reported for a range of surgical and interventional specialties and has attracted considerable debate. However, the evidence for vascular surgery is robust and an association
            has been repeatedly demonstrated between higher annual caseload and lower operative mortality for AAA repair.
        </p>
        <p class="text">In a study from 2002 including 140,000 AAA repairs in Medicare the 30 day mortality was 8% for low volume hospitals (&lt;17/year) compared to 4% in high volume hospitals (&gt;79/year).<a href="64"><span
                    class="text-sup">64</span></a> Similarly, a 13% reduction in the odds of mortality for each additional 20 cases performed was observed in a UK audit<a href="279"><span class="text-sup">279</span></a> A meta-analysis of international
            practice, including 421,229 elective AAA repairs, demonstrated signiﬁcantly favourable outcomes from higher volume units with a pooled effect estimate for mortality of odds ratio 0.66 (95% CI 0.65-0.67) for units performing 43 AAA repairs
            per year.<a href="278"><span class="text-sup">278</span></a> A recent study including &gt;120,000 Medicare patients undergoing elective EVAR found a threshold for optimal outcomes of 30 EVAR cases per year.<a href="788"><span class="text-sup">788</span></a>            Others suggest a lower threshold of &#8805;10 EVAR cases in a setting with a total volume, including OSR, of &#8805;50 repairs per year.<a href="378"><span
                    class="text-sup">378</span></a></p>
        <p class="text">In addition to the relationship between hospital volume and mortality, a similar association has been observed for surgeons’ caseload and outcome.<a href="548"><span class="text-sup">548</span></a> However, this is harder to interpret in the modern
            era, when AAA repair is performed by teams rather than individuals.<a href="33"><span
                    class="text-sup">33</span></a></p>
        <p class="text">The associations between volume and outcome have also been shown in the emergency setting, for ruptured AAA (rAAA) repair<a href="526"><span class="text-sup">526</span></a><span class="text-sup">,</span><a href="174"><span class="text-sup">174</span></a>
            <span class="text-sup">,</span><a href="124"><span class="text-sup">124</span></a><span class="text-sup">,</span><a href="99"><span class="text-sup">99</span></a> and recent studies document that it is safe to transfer most rAAA patients to
            the nearest high volume specialised vascular centre and that such a policy may, in fact, decrease mortality.
            <a href="435"><span class="text-sup">435</span></a><span class="text-sup">,</span><a href="531"><span
                    class="text-sup">531</span></a>
            <span class="text-sup">,</span><a href="277"><span class="text-sup">277</span></a> In a recent international registry study, including 9273 patients from 11 countries treated for rAAA, the peri-operative mortality was lower in centres with
            a primary EVAR approach or with high caseload volume; 23% in centres &gt;22 repairs per year versus 30% in centres with a caseload &lt;22, <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001. The observed difference in outcome was predominantly seen
            after OSR, while no significant difference in peri-operative mortality after EVAR between centres based on volume could be observed. With most repairs still performed in very low volume centres and in centres with a primary OSR strategy reorganisation
            of acute vascular surgical services has the potential to improve outcomes of rAAA repair.<a href="99"><span
                    class="text-sup">99</span></a></p>
        <p class="text">Surgeon speciality also has signiﬁcance for the outcome of AAA repair. In a study from the USA elective AAA mortality was lowest when operations were performed by vascular surgeons (2.2%), compared to cardiac surgeons (4%) and general surgeons
            (5.5%) (
            <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). AAA repair performed by a general surgeon increased the risk of death by 76% compared to repair performed by a vascular surgeon.<a href="162"><span
                    class="text-sup">162</span></a> The likelihood of receiving EVAR rather than OSR was higher when vascular surgeons performed the operation compared with treatment by general surgeons and cardiac surgeons.
            <a href="706"><span class="text-sup">706</span></a> There is, however, no comparative study between vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists, who today represent the two specialities that perform most AAA operations. In addition,
            several operations are now being carried out by a multidisciplinary team, making it difﬁcult to provide a clear recommendation. Even if no speciﬁc recommendation on the specialtyis made, the GWC advocates that AAA surgery should be done under
            the leadership of a vascular surgeon.
        </p>
        <p class="text">In summary, the firm evidence of a volume outcome relationship makes it necessary and justifiable to make a recommendation on surgical volume. No clear threshold has, however, been defined in the literature. Instead, various cut off levels have
            been suggested. Important methodological differences between the studies, such as different healthcare systems, study design, surgical techniques, and populations, make it difficult to perform a formal meta-analysis of the optimal surgical
            volume. In addition, this is a sensitive issue with political implications making it challenging to provide a recommendation that can be accepted by everyone. Based on the literature, the GWC concluded that there is enough evidence for a rather
            strong recommendation on the required minimum volume to perform aortic surgery at all, and a weaker recommendation on the desired minimum volume, which should also work in different healthcare settings and geographies and be accepted by most.</p>
        <p class="text">Although available data indicate that surgical volume has an important impact on the outcome after OSR and to a lesser extent after EVAR, when adding detail to Recommendation 2, no distinction is made between EVAR and OSR and both types of repair
            should be included in the total volume of cases.</p>

        <p class="text">RCTs have demonstrated the safety of a policy of ultrasonographic surveillance for asymptomatic AAAs below the threshold for elective repair. Above this threshold, the risk of rupture increases exponentially, however, with significant individual
            variation.
            <a href="533"><span class="text-sup">533</span></a> There are limited data concerning a reasonable waiting time for treatment once the threshold for repair has been reached.</p>
        <p class="text">Based on a retrospective analysis of 361 patients assigned for elective AAA repair, Noronen et al. suggested that the period from referral to operation should vary by AAA diameter: urgent (within 48 h) for AAAs &gt; 9 cm, one month for AAAs 7-9
            cm, two months for AAAs 6-7 cm, and three months for AAAs &lt; 6 cm.<a href="511"><span
                    class="text-sup">511</span></a> In the EVAR 2 trial, a RCT evaluating the long-term outcomes in physically frail patients with AAA treated with either early EVAR or no intervention, about 5% ruptured after randomisation but before
            attempted surgery. The median aortic diameter was 6.4 cm and the median time between randomisation and repair was eight weeks.
            <a href="192"><span class="text-sup">192</span></a><span class="text-sup">,</span><a href="193"><span
                    class="text-sup">193</span></a> That rate is probably on the borderline of what is acceptable and thus indicates a possible upper limit on the waiting time for surgery.</p>
        <p class="text">The AAA size also affects what is an acceptable waiting time to repair. In a retrospective study of 138 AAA patients not undergoing immediate repair, the cumulative rupture rate was 4% at one year, 16% at three years, and 36% at five years in
            patients with baseline diameter 5.5-6.9 cm AAAs versus 35%, 71% and 100% in those with &gt; 7 cm AAAs.<a href="615"><span class="text-sup">615</span></a> In a recent meta-analysis, including 11 studies with total 1514 patients reporting follow
            up of untreated large AAA, the annual rupture rates was 3.5% in AAAs 5.5-6.0 cm, 4.1% in AAAs 6.1-7.0 cm, and 6.3% in AAAs &gt 7.0 cm.<a href="533"><span class="text-sup">533</span></a></p>
        <p class="text">In addition, there are psychological consequences of living with a large AAA, which seem to be reversible by surgery,</a><a href="275"><span class="text-sup">275</span></a><span class="text-sup">,</span><a href="407"><span class="text-sup">407</span></a>            which further underlines the need to keep the waiting time for referral and treatment at a minimum.</p>
        <p class="text">Although there is no strong evidence to support exact timings, it is reasonable to adopt a similar approach as for other potentially lethal diseases, such as malignant disease. A suggested upper limit for the total pathway from referral to treatment
            is eight weeks, once the intervention threshold has been reached. This applies, however, only to standard AAA cases, whereas in more complex aneurysms or comorbid patients a lengthier planning or work up time may be justified. Correspondingly,
            a shorter timeframe should be pursued for larger AAAs.</p>

        <p class="text">Management of aortic diseases includes dealing with true emergencies, such as rupture, requiring quick and efficient handling that places high demands on the organisation. Establishing a protocol or algorithm for managing these emergencies is
            important to obtain optimal outcomes.<a href="467"><span class="text-sup">467</span></a><span class="text-sup">,</span><a href="489"><span class="text-sup">489</span></a><span class="text-sup">,</span><a href="651"><span class="text-sup">651</span></a>            A 35% relative risk reduction in 30 day mortality for managing rAAA, corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of 22.5%, was reported after implementation of a structured protocol.<a href="651"><span class="text-sup">651</span></a>

        <p class="text">Aneurysm, from the Ancient Greek word &#940;&#957;&epsilon;&#250;&rho;&#965;&sigma;&#956;&alpha;, means a dilatation or widening of an artery, most commonly being fusiform in shape. This chapter focuses on infrarenal AAAs. The most widespread
            definition of an AAA is based on the diameter of the abdominal aorta: an abdominal aortic diameter of 3.0 cm or more, which usually is more than 2 standard deviations above the mean diameter for men, is considered to be aneurysmal.
            <span class="text">186,388,409</span> This definition, based on external ultrasound diameters had a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 97% in predicting the need for AAA repair within 10 years.<a href="210"><span class="text-sup">210</span></a>            A lower threshold might be more appropriate in women and some Asian populations.<a href="399"><span class="text-sup">399</span></a><span class="text-sup">,</span><a href="672"><span class="text-sup">672</span></a></p>

        <p class="text">Diameter measurements vary according to imaging methodology, with inner to inner wall measurements being about 0.3-0.6 cm smaller than outer to outer wall measurements, with leading edge to leading edge measurements being intermediate.
            <a href="246"><span class="text-sup">246</span></a><span class="text-sup">,</span><a href="260"><span

                    class="text-sup">682</span></a> Therefore, all studies should specify the site and plane of measurement of aortic diameter. Other researchers have suggested defining AAA as the maximum infrarenal aortic diameter being at least 1.5
            times larger than the expected normal infrarenal aortic diameter or suprarenal aortic diameter to compensate for individual variation in the diameter of the adjacent aorta and the different diameters measured.<a href="304"><span class="text-sup">304</span></a>

            <a href="339"><span class="text-sup">339</span></a> This 1.5 fold diameter increase also provides a useful basis for the definition of AAA in women, iliac artery and other aneurysms.</p>

        <p class="text"><span class="bold">2.1.1.1. Suggested reporting standards for AAA.</span></p>
        <p class="listlevel1">AAA in men of European origin can be defined as an abdominal aortic diameter of 3.0 cm in either anteroposterior or transverse planes. A lower threshold might be more appropriate in women and some Asian populations.</p>
        <p class="listlevel1">AAA also can be defined when the maximum diameter is &#8805; 50% greater than the suprarenal diameter.</p>
        <p class="listlevel1">The calliper placement, plane, and site of all measurements must be reported. This is particularly relevant for CT measurements, where the diameter in a plane perpendicular to the centreline should be reported and for all measurements the position
            of calliper placement should be specified: see Chapter 2.2 for full details.</p>

        <p class="text">Symptoms or signs of an intact AAA, if present, are mainly pain or tenderness on palpation, localised to the AAA or radiating to the back or to the genitals. Symptoms may be related to complications, either by compression of nearby organs (duodenal

            of the thoracic aorta.
        </p>
        <p class="text"> Some of these limitations can be resolved by training and reporting standards: measurement performed in diastole versus systole, may result in a 2 mm lower diameter.<a href="240"><span
                    class="text-sup">240</span></a> The use of a standardised US protocol including ECG gating and subsequent ofﬂine reading with minute calliper placement reduces variability.

        <p class="text">Computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) plays a key role in assessing the extent of disease and therapeutic decision making and planning. CTA is also the recommended imaging modality for the diagnosis of rupture and is an important tool in
            follow up after repair.<a href="589"><span class="text-sup">589</span></a></p>

        <p class="text">Many of the same issues concerning measurement by US apply to CT measurement, for example axial versus orthogonal centreline diameters, changes with the cardiac cycle and details of calliper placement.
            <a href="490"><span class="text-sup">490</span></a><span class="text-sup">,</span><a href="491"><span
                    class="text-sup">491</span></a> When applying predefined methodologies, intra-observer reproducibility can be within the clinically accepted range (&#177; 5 mm) in 90% AAA measurements, but the inter-observer reproducibility is poor,
            with 87% comparisons being outside &#177; 5 mm.<span class="text">490</span> This variability is of particularly high clinical significance, since the number of patients considered for AAA repair, based on a diameter threshold, may vary from
            11% to 24%, 5%-20%, and 15%-23% for three different radiologists.<a href="490"><span
                    class="text-sup">490</span></a> There is no evidence whether this variability could be reduced with ECG gating, which carries the disadvantage of increased radiation dosage.<a href="240"><span
                    class="text-sup">240</span></a></p>

        <p class="text">CTA provides several advantages for intervention planning: it provides a complete data set of the entire aorta (including the thoracic aorta) and access vessels, which with dedicated post-processing software enables analysis in three perpendicular
            planes, construction of a centreline, and accurate diameter and length measurement. This reconstruction allows for pre-intervention planning for EVAR and three dimensional image fusion of CTA and angiography for real time peri-operative guidance.
            A prerequisite for a good reconstruction is CTA with 1 mm slice thickness. CTA provides additional information on patency/stenosis of arterial tributaries, position and/or duplication of the left renal vein, neck morphology, and aortic wall
            integrity at the level of the neck, useful for endovascular and OSR planning.</p>
        <p class="text">Limitations include the use of nephrotoxic contrast agents and radiation. It is important to assess renal function before CT scan and to ensure adequate hydration for those with marginal renal function. Recent evidence does not suggest that there
            are clear advantages for any specific hydration protocol including whether hydration is oral or intravenous.
            <a href="351"><span class="text-sup">351</span></a><span class="text-sup">,</span>
            <a href="451"><span class="text-sup">451</span></a>
        </p>
        <p class="text">Irradiation of the patient, especially with repeated CT scanning, may have an ensuing cancer risk. The mean estimated annual cumulative effective dose is 104 mSv per patient-year for EVAR, with a 0.8% average risk of exposure induced death.
            <a href="86"><span class="text-sup">86</span></a> The radiation risk during EVAR may be higher in younger patients.
            <a href="72"><span class="text-sup">72</span></a> Several methods are emerging to reduce the radiation dosage associated with CT scans.
        </p>

        <p class="text">Finally, there is often poor agreement between US and CTA diameters, particularly close to the treatment threshold. Again, much of this difference is probably attributable to inadequate reporting standards with respect to specification of aortic
            axis, plane of measurement and calliper placement, although differences in instrumentation also will be contributory. Most often, this results in a larger diameter on CTA compared with US, and it has been reported that for US diameters of
            50-55 mm, up to 70% of AAAs exceed 55 mm on CTA.<a href="207"><span class="text-sup">207</span></a> US is recommended for surveillance of small AAA and CTA for pre-operative imaging, i.e. CTA should be performed when the size threshold for

            <a href="244"><span class="text-sup">244</span></a> Overall there was a reduction in AAA specific mortality with the Cochrane review reporting the odds ratio in favour of screening for men as 0.60 (95% CI 0.47-0.78) and the USA Preventive
            Task Force reporting an odds ratio of 0.53 (95% CI 0.42-0.68). There was significant reduction in AAA related mortality in the MASS and Viborg trials at all time points from 3 to 15 years of follow up but not in the Australian trial.-
            <a href="458"><span class="text-sup">458</span></a> This latter trial has recently published its long-term follow up and these data have been included in a meta-analysis in the associated editorial.
            <a href="390"><span class="text-sup">390</span></a> At the longest reported follow up from each trial, all cause mortality was significantly lower in the groups invited to screening, risk ratio 0.987 (95% CI 0.975-0.999,
            <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.03).<a href="390"><span class="text-sup">390</span></a> Therefore, aneurysm screening is almost unique in reducing both cause specific and all cause mortality. A recent Swedish nationwide study confirmed the

        <p class="text">There are several limitations in translating the results of these screening trials to contemporary practice. The trials all started in the last century when the prevalence of AAA was 4-7% in the men screened and most of the repairs were performed
            using open surgery. Today the population prevalence of AAA has reduced by two to threefold in several European countries and EVAR has become the treatment modality in elective and increasingly in emergency repairs too. In addition, with more
            widespread use of diagnostic imaging, the incidental detection rate of AAA is likely to have increased. Also, life expectancy has increased substantially. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider the contemporary evidence from two European
            countries with national aneurysm screening programmes for older men (UK and Sweden) and the Danish VIVA trial. These three studies indicate that screening remains cost effective in these health economies.

            in terms of lives saved and cost benefit has not been assessed formally.</p>

        <p class="text">In the final follow up of MASS the long-term protective effect of screening appeared to decline due to ruptures after &#8805; 8 years among men initially screened normal (&lt; 3.0 cm). Approximately half of these ruptures occurred among those

        <p class="text">Recently, a discrete event simulation model was developed to provide a clinically realistic model of screening, surveillance, and elective and emergency AAA repair operations. Input parameters specifically for women were employed, and parameter
            uncertainty addressed by deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The base case model adopted the same age at screening (65 years), definition of AAA (&#8805; 3.0 cm), surveillance intervals and AAA diameter for consideration
            of surgery (5.5 cm) as for men. The prevalence was low (0.43%) and operative mortality rates about twice as high as in men. The simulation model showed that the base case and all alternative scenarios (including screening at older ages, definition
            of AAA as 2.5 cm, intervention at lower thresholds) resulted in minimal gain in quality adjusted life years and would probably not be cost effective. The authors suggest that while population screening of women should not be considered at
            this time, further information is required about the aortic size distribution, definition of an AAA, and harms of screening in women.<a href="671"><span class="text-sup">671</span></a>
